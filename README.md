# LIMNemu (C+SDL)

Emulates the LIMNstation fantasy computer, inspired by late 80s Unix workstations.

The long-term goal is to create a really neat (but useless) emulated desktop computer.

Ships with a pre-built [boot ROM](https://github.com/limnarch/a3x) binary.

Also see the more featured, but way (way) slower, [Love2D/LuaJIT implementation](https://github.com/limnarch/emu).

## Running

Make sure you have SDL2 installed.

Building the emulator should be as simple as typing `make`.

Then, type `./graphical.sh` in the project directory.
